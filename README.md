# CCSRobotics
## About
This repo was created with the purpose of holding code samples and working demonstrations so that future CCS Robotics students have something to refer back to and learn from.  
Documentation can be found in both code comments and the documentation folders and subfolders.  
  
For students that are trying to learn, please clone or fork this and experiment with the code and code samples. Those with access to this repo should know how to contact me for help with understanding some of the concepts.

## Contributing
Pull requests are limited only to students of Columbia Christian School. I will handle all pull requests myself for the time being and when I graduate I will put someone else in charge of this repository with the hopes that they will continue it for future classes.  
In the event you want to contribute, please make sure all your code is documented thoroughly. You may document it through comments in the code, or by documenting it separately in the proper folders and subfolders.
