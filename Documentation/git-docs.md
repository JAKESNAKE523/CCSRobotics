# Git Documentation
## Introduction to Git
Git is used to keep control of program and website versions. It is handy when managing large projects where multiple people may contribute, or even projects with just one developer. Websites such as Github and Gitlab are places to host git repositories. It is possible to create a local git repository, however for our purposes you will be using a site such as Github or Gitlab. 
## Using Git
For git, you will likely need to learn how to use CLI and commands. Most of this could be done without CLI using the github desktop program, but I recommend learning CLI and commands because it will benefit you in the long run.  For now I recommend installing [Git for Windows](https://desktop.github.com/) if you don't already have it installed. This is because it comes with the GUI version as well as the CLI version.  
This tutorial assumes you are using windows, although the commands for git should be the same on Linux or MacOS. I will include special instruction for Mac later since theres some extra things that need to be taken care of. Linux git should work out of the box once you install it through your preferred package manager.

Once you have git installed you can open up the command prompt on windows (Win + R)
