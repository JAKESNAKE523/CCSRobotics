# Git Documentation
## Introduction to Git
Git is used to keep control of program and website versions. It is handy when managing large projects where multiple people may contribute, or even projects with just one developer. Websites such as Github and Gitlab are places to host git repositories. It is possible to create a local git repository, however for our purposes you will be using a site such as Github or Gitlab. 
## Using Git
For git, you will likely need to learn how to use CLI and commands. Most of this could be done without CLI using the github desktop program, but I recommend learning CLI and commands because it will benefit you in the long run.  For now I recommend installing [Git for Windows](https://desktop.github.com/) if you don't already have it installed. This is because it comes with the GUI version as well as the CLI version.  
This tutorial assumes you are using windows, although the commands for git should be the same on Linux or MacOS. I will include special instruction for Mac later since theres some extra things that need to be taken care of. Linux git should work out of the box once you install it through your preferred package manager.

Once you have git installed you can open up the command prompt on windows by pressing Win + R and then typing cmd and hitting enter.

## Learning Git  
This documentation is short and doesn't contain much. I will expand it throughout the year, but it is still recommended that you take a look at some other various materials that will help you to understand the basics of git better and more thoroughly.

The [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) takes only about 10 minutes to read and will give you a good idea of how git works, what it is used for, and how to use it.  

If you need an interactive way to learn git, use this [Git Branching Exersize](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) to learn or practice git commands online.  

If you ever forget a command, just refer to this [Git Cheatsheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/) to quickly find some of the most used git commands.
If you want to learn the basics of git interactively, use this [Codecademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git).  This document is meant as a short, small guide that only teaches the basics. There is much more to learn about git if you want to be a power user.
