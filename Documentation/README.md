# Documentation  
This folder is used for documenting code and technologies used in robotics.  
  
Currently all documentation is written in markdown because that was easy and quick. There may be a more efficent and more organized way that all of this can be converted to later.
  
If you don't know where to begin, start at [basic-docs.md](basic-docs.md).

If you want to see website documentation and view recommended resources please go to [website-docs.md](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

Currently the documentation links to alot of external resources since I haven't yet had time to write all of that from scratch.
