# Markdown Documentation
As with the other tutorials, I haven't had time yet to go in detail. I plan on adding more  information about basic markdown later. The reason I use markdown for documentation is because the syntax is easy to learn and memorize, and looks fairly natural.  In addition it is already used for Github readmes so it makes it something that is already fairly necessary to learn.  

For learning markdown I recommend going to [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/). It has a cheat sheet as well as some basic getting started guides.
