# Basic Documentation  
If you're wanting to get started, there are a few requirements for tinkering with the code. If you don't have these or do not understand what they are, continue reading and I will explain where to find or learn these things.
These requirements include the following:
 - A text editor or IDE
 - Basic knowledge of git
 - Understanding of terminals and CLI usage
Other useful things to know or learn while messing with the code:
 - Programming (C, javascipt) and web scripting languages (css,html)
 - An understanding of markdown
