# Basic Documentation  
If you're wanting to get started, there are a few requirements for tinkering with the code. If you don't have these or do not understand what they are, continue reading and I will explain where to find or learn these things.
These requirements include the following:
 - A text editor or IDE
 - Basic knowledge of git
 - Understanding of terminals and CLI usage
Other useful things to know or learn while messing with the code:
 - Programming (C, javascipt) and web scripting languages (css,html)
 - An understanding of markdown
   
 ## Text Editor or IDE
 A text editor or IDE is just the interface used for programming or writing scripts. For html, css, javascript, and markup I recommend Visual Studio Code, although Atom editor is also a good choice. For RobotC you should use the IDE that they recommend.  
 
 IDEs usually have more features than text editors and allow code-formatting and check the code as you write it. They usually are easier and more efficient to use.
 ## Basic knowledge of git
 Git is a bigger topic so I'll cover that over in it's on page: [git-docs.md](git-docs.md)
 ## Terminals and CLI Usage
 Terminals are used for running commands that will be used for git. They are also a quick way to run scripts, create directories, as well as create and edit files. Some people prefer command line interfaces over menu based interfaces because they are faster to navigate, use less resources, and are straight to the point. For this you will mostly just need to be familiar with the basics of terminals so you are comfortable using commands such as git.  
 
 ## Programming
 I'll split the programming into two parts. The first includes C and JavaScript which are your traditional programming languages. The second includes CSS and HTML which are not your traditional langauges. They aren't actually even programming langauges.
 ### C and Javascript
 ### CSS and HTML
 As mentioned before, these are not actually programming languages but scripting languages instead. They just dictate the structure and look of websites.
 ## Markdown
 Markdown is small and mostly unimportant. The reason I include this here is for writing docs like this and readme files for opensource projects.  
 It is really simple to learn and you can find guides easily online.
